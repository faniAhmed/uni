Task 3:
Problem:
A program that checks whether the number is prime or not.
Input:
One Number
Ouput:
The Number you Entered is Prime.
OR
The Number you Entered is not Prime.
Mathematical formula:
Dividing num with each Number before its half, to Check if it is Divisible.
If Nivisible then Number is Not Prime else it is Prime.
Design:
//including library istream
#include<iostream>

//defining standard namespace
using namespace std;

int main(){
	//Variable Declaration
	int num, x;
	//inializing p_check to true 
	bool p_check = true;
  
	
	//getting input from user
	cout<<"Enter any Natural Number:";
	cin>>num;
	
	//if num is 1 or 2 it is a prime number
	if(num == 1 || num == 2)
	cout<<"The Number you Entered is Prime.";
	
	//if num is not 1 or 2
	else
	{
		//loop runs from 2 to n-1
		for(x=2;x<(n/2);x++)
		{
			
			if(num % x == 0)
			{
				//p_check becomes false and loop breaks
				p_check = false;
				break;
				
			}

		}
		
		//If p_check true then num is Prime else num is Not Prime
		if (p_check)
		cout<<"Its a Prime Number";
		else
		cout<<"Its not a Prime Number";
	}
	
	//return 0 as integer ,as return datatype of main() function is int
	return 0;
	
}
